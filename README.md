# computerScienceNotes

## Purpose

This repo hosts notes and how-to guides on various programming topics.
It was created to provide help on some common issues and centralize all the knowledge on different programming languages.

The hope is to limit the amount of times you would have to search for an answer online.

## Structure

The repo is split in a series of wikis, either by programming language or by topic. Some topics, for example web_development, will contain many programming languages, but the code wil be specific to uses related to web development.

Any large enough topic will warrant its own wiki page.

## Usage

Browse to the relevant file and either Ctrl + F in the page, or use the Markdown headers, top-left in Github, to find a topic of interest.
